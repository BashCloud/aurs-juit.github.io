# AURS-JUIT
This is the source code behind [aurs-juit.github.io](https://github.com/aurs-juit.github.io)<BR> The community website for Aerial and Underwater Robotics Society, JUIT. [AURS-JUIT](https://aurs-juit.github.io)
<br>
The most unique thing about this website is the fact that, it is maintained by the entire community and not just the admin of the society.<br>

Being a club focussed on Robitcs and Programming, we felt the best way to develop a collaborative and well maintained website is by allowing people to add content as and when necessary.<br>

But there is a twist, We add content via sending pull requests!<br>

Its a strange way to add content, isn't it? But you are a developer, right? <br>Pull Requests must be something you have heard of.

Once you feel quite familiar with creating/sending a pull request, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/aurs-juit/aurs-juit.github.io/wiki/) for adding various types of content, namely: Community Hacks, Resources.
